dotfiles
========

This repo is the beginnings of my personal dotfiles, which may or may not be
useful. Feel free to copy/steal things here.

I'm using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage my
dotfiles. Running the `install` script will attempt to create the symlinks
defined in `install.conf.yaml`.

Since I'm massively indebted towards people who have shared their dotfiles
publicly on the Internet, I'll make my dotfiles available under the
MIT license.
